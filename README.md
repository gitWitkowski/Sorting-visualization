# Sorting algorithms visualization

## Simple project that allows user to visualize different sorting algorithms with given parameters such as number of elements and delay.

### Goal of the project
This project was built in my free time to practise programming skills and refresh some of my knowledge about sorting algorithms, as well as to continue writing programs in C++ myself, after finishing a C++ course at university. Additionally, I learned the basics of multithreading in C++ and got acquainted with [`std::jthread`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/jthread) which is part of C++20.
 
### Technologies used
- C++
- [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/)
- [wxFormBuilder](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxformbuilder/)
- Microsoft Visual Studio
